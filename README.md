# A starter webpack for React and Redux

This is a starter boilerplate for a React/Redux application that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6. It uses a mock database file that is served on port 3000. The client side application is on port 8080. Also includes tape and enzyme testing frameworks.
To use, clone this repo and then `npm install`.

To start the development application with a watcher that refreshes your browser, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/static`. To run the server, run `npm start`

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.
